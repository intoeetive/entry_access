# Entry Access for ExpressionEngine 2

This add-on enables you to restrict front-end access to certain channel entries for certain members or member group


Install the add-on, define the groups and/or idividual members whom you want to grant access on publish tab (when creating or editing the entry). A nice select control with filtering option is for your service there.

Then, include into your channel entries call two new tag pairs: {grant_access} and {deny_access}.

That’s all, you’re done! Now only selected members will have access to the entry.

The restrictions also apply to editing entry from CP.

Default permissions (for a new entry) can be set in extension settings.

Supports member categories
